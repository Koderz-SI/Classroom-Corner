<b>Problem Statement<b/><br><br>
In the current covid situation, students, as well as teachers, struggle with different modes of communication to connect with each other (For eg, google classroom, WhatsApp, etc). Thus, we strongly need a portal that handles all the online affairs of a classroom (Students & Faculty) collectively.
  
<b>About Project:</b><br/>
  1. TESTS  <br/>
    We thrive to make the experience of examination easy for the students as well as the faculty. This feature provides MCQ based tests, auto submission, immediate result  after submitting and much more! <br/>
 

  2. ADMIN VERIFICATION <br/>
    This portal aims towards building a healthy work environment. Hence all the content and changes in the content will be verified my the admin.
   
  3. ANNOUNCEMENT  <br/>
  Since we're connecting the staff and students via this portal, so you can expect this feature to be present. It will help the staff to put up new announcements, modify old announcements and mark announcements on the basis of urgency!
  
  4. STUDY MATERIAL <br/>
   There's so much study material available online. But the moment you download it, it gets lost in your device. This feature will bring all those in one place, segregated in folders for easy access. The students and the faculty can use this to share their findings.</li>
    
   5. BUY AND SELL PRODUCTS <br/>
