<b>Problem Statement<b/><br><br>
In the current covid situation, students, as well as teachers, struggle with different modes of communication to connect with each other (For eg, google classroom, WhatsApp, etc). Thus, we strongly need a portal that handles all the online affairs of a classroom (Students & Faculty) collectively.
  
<b>About Project:</b><br/>
  1. TESTS  <br/>
    We thrive to make the experience of examination easy for the students as well as the faculty. This feature provides MCQ based tests, auto submission, immediate result  after submitting and much more! <br/>
 

  2. FACULTY VERIFICATION<br/>
    Misinformation is the most dangerous thing in the world. We don't want the students to suffer from such thing hence we came up with this feature. The faculty of the college is verified by the admin in order to use the portal. If not then anyone can post information on behalf of the faculty.
   
  3. ANNOUNCEMENT  <br/>
  Since we're connecting the staff and students via this portal, so you can expect this feature to be present. It will help the staff to put up new announcements and mark announcements on the basis of urgency!
  
  4. STUDY MATERIAL <br/>
   There's so much study material available online. But the moment you download it, it gets lost in your device. This feature will bring all those in one place for easy access. The students and the faculty can use this to share their findings.</li>
    
   5. BUY AND SELL PRODUCTS <br/> 
    Every college is conducting online classes during this pandemic. Right now, students need books, papers, instruments in order to complete their assignments. Here you can buy and sell materials to your fellow college mates!
    
   6. ADMIN PANEL <br/>
   This portal aims towards building a healthy work environment. This feature allows the admin watch over all the content that is being put on the portal. This is to avoid spamming and harmful content to be displayed.
